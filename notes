implement stuff for 
"Tend":[this,TendWater], "destroy":[this,DestroyWater]



create running console of shit
show health of farm on bump


less than  0, should leq 0

if health low, user and farm, warm the person ok!!


verify we eating fam affects the right farm fam


we need a fucking array for this shit;
dispatch(currentperson,farm, );


problem is for other people we don't want continous collision and gain/deteriment, we want to boost off slightly on collide, right?

this might be the problem with car collisions right now
